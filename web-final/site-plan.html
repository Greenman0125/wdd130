      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to provide a fun and interesting way for users to practice some elements of web design. While limited in scope, the site itself is meant to test an alternate method of teaching people and thus this website is structured like a "demo" or proof of concept. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target auidence is meant to be learning/beginning students of web design and development so that they are able to understand and be more engaged in learning some of the concepts in their classes.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My site is meant to be a place where students studying some of the basics of web design and web development can practice and have an interactive way of learning each concept I’ll put into the site. For most people perhaps outside of WDD130, they likely won’t know what cssbattle.dev is and this site is meant to be similar in concept, although it will be more basic in practice, it’s purpose is largely the same. In comparison to other sites, this is meant to be a simplified and unique take on interactive HTML and CSS concepts albeit similar to cssbattle.dev. Instead of focusing on a slightly competitive basis with leaderboards and challenges, this is meant to be a more individual way of practicing or refreshing your knowledge of different concepts.

      <h3>What's Here</h3>
      <p>
        This site is meant to both teach certain concepts, while also just giving practice to those who already know the basics. My site will answer questions that people have when trying to figure out what way to figure out a certain design requirement, or if people don’t understand the steps necessary to do it in any way. Since the entire point is to be both interactive and kind of fun, simple yet interesting tasks will be present and the solutions or explanations as to how to do each task will be shown in a way that people can easily understand and follow the entire time and keep their attention. Since this site is also going to be relatively basic in practice, it’s mainly meant to explore the ways that something like this can be done. I plan to give some examples/tasks for people aimed at those who are just learning or who know nothing. There will be a page explaining the basics, a page for explaining differences in approaches and how to design/format different things, and then there will be another page meant to have different challenges where people can go through different exercises that walk them through how they would design or create said task. I could use a scrollbar with different flashcards or something similar to flashcards so that as people write out or think through what they would do, they can view each step and see how it compares.

      </ul>
      <h3>Potential Features</h3>
      <p>
        Since this site will be pretty simple, for those that do use the website, I think it would be a good idea to have some sort of a comment thread or a forum of some kind or just a place where users of the site can all go and ask any questions they have so others can answer them. I have a lot of ideas that I could use for this site but I don’t know if I will actually know how to make any of them in an actual website. I had thought of making a kind of page-based puzzle where as people go through each challenge, they go to another page of the website and each puzzle gets harder until they make it through all of them. At the end it could ask them if they liked the concept, enjoyed the puzzles, and if they had any questions or things that they wanted fixed, like if something wasn’t quite accurate or didn’t work right. While this felt like the most original and honestly fun option, it would be a whole lot of work to make enough pages to make a puzzle that felt long enough if I were to use only 2-3 pages and making more would add a lot of potential for mistakes. Another concern was actually implementing that because if I were to put all the information to solve each puzzle on each page, even if each puzzle wasn’t answering something in a unique way, hiding a link to the next page behind a correct answer wouldn’t work too well because there isn’t exactly anything stopping the user from just moving on and I don’t know how to “hide” so to speak, a link and how would entering a correct answer then make that link appear. So there really isn’t any feasible way that I, with what I know could make a site like that in the way that I would hope that I could.
